# GPU-Accelerated MapReduce Performance Analysis

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze and compare the performance of MapReduce tasks executed on GPUs versus CPUs. Our primary goal is to benchmark the execution time differences between these two processing units, highlighting the efficiency and speed improvements offered by GPU processing.

### Key Objectives

- **Benchmarking MapReduce on GPUs**: Our initial phase involves running MapReduce tasks on GPUs to evaluate their performance.
- **Comparison with CPU Performance**: Subsequent analysis will compare these results with equivalent tasks performed on CPUs.
- **Cross-GPU Performance Analysis**: Future plans include testing and comparing performance across different GPU models to assess scalability and efficiency.

## Technologies Used

- **MapReduce Framework**: The core technology for processing large-scale data.
- **GPU Acceleration**: Leveraging GPU power to enhance processing speed.

## Current Progress

- Successfully implemented and executed MapReduce tasks on a GPU.
